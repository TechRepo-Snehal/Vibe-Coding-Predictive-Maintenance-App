# 🧠 Vibe Coding: Predictive Maintenance App with Python + GenAI + VS Code

This repository showcases a simple yet powerful **Predictive Maintenance application** built through **Vibe Coding** — an emerging approach that blends your foundational Python + AI/ML knowledge with the power of GenAI tools like **Gemini** and **GitHub Copilot** to build working ML apps quickly and intuitively.

Whether you're a student, an AI/ML enthusiast, or a tech consultant exploring real-world prototyping, this project is your entry point into **building functional machine learning applications with minimal friction**.

💡 My Vibe Coding Journey
I started with foundational knowledge in AI/ML + Python, and wanted to build something practical — a predictive maintenance app that could be relevant across industries.

Here’s how I did it:
◉ Gemini helped me find a relevant public dataset and generated working code using Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn
◉ I moved the code into VS Code, where I was a total beginner
◉ GitHub Copilot helped me install packages, resolve errors, and improve the app
◉ I added my own twist: generating random sensor values to simulate fresh predictions

As a technical consultant, this opens new possibilities — I can now quickly prototype ML-powered apps to demonstrate real value to customers beyond just slide decks.

## ✨ What Is Vibe Coding?

> **Vibe Coding** = Foundational Skills + GenAI Assistants + Real-World Prototyping

Instead of writing everything from scratch, I used:
- 🔮 **Gemini** to generate the dataset, core logic, and model recommendations
- 💡 **GitHub Copilot** to guide my coding process in **VS Code** — from fixing bugs to suggesting enhancements
- 🛠️ **VS Code** as my main development environment, even as a beginner
---

## ⚙️ What This Repo Includes

- ✅ `predictive_maintenance.py`: The full Python code to run and experiment with
- ✅ `requirements.txt`: Python packages used (lightweight setup)
- ✅ Clear guidance for beginners — just copy, paste, and let Copilot do the rest
- ✅ No prior VS Code or Copilot experience required!
---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

1. **Install Python**  
   Download Python 3.8+ from 👉 [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. **Install VS Code**  
   Download from 👉 [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)

3. **Install Extensions in VS Code**
   - Python (by Microsoft)
   - GitHub Copilot
   - (Optional) Jupyter

4. **Install Required Libraries**  
   Run this in your terminal or VS Code:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

💡 Pro tip: If you miss anything, GitHub Copilot will automatically suggest what to install and even generate installation commands for you!

🧪 How to Run the App
→ Open VS Code
→ Create a new folder
→ Place the dataset file (ai4i2020.CSV file) placed in the repo 
→ Create a new Python file and copy contents from predictive_maintenance.py
→ Accept suggestions from Copilot to install missing packages or fix errors
→ Run the file — you'll see model training, accuracy metrics, and predictions

Try tweaking the code to:

● Add new sensor values
● Simulate live data
● Try different ML models (e.g. RandomForest, XGBoost)

🛠️ Customize Your Own Version
Here are a few ideas to make this your own:
🔄 Swap the dataset (Gemini can help suggest alternatives)
🧠 Try different ML models (RandomForest, SVM, etc.)
📊 Add visualizations (Matplotlib or Seaborn)
🌐 Deploy using Streamlit or Flask

Happy Vibe Coding!!
